# 🖥️ SysView - System Info API

**SysView** is a lightweight Node.js REST API that exposes useful system and process information using only core Node.js modules — no external dependencies.

This project is great for learning how to build native HTTP servers in Node.js, and can also be used for lightweight system monitoring or diagnostics.
